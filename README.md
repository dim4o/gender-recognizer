# Gender Recognizer

The aim of the paper is to choose the best gender classification Machine Learning model between Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and Adaptive Boost algorithms.

## How to run the demo

To run the code you need to install [Python Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) distribution or to install the following dependencies:

- [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install) (Jupyter Notebook)
- [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) (you can skip this and to install later from the Jupyter Notebook)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

### For Anaconda users
I do not recommend the `opencv` that comes with `Anaconda` distribution. Currently it does not work perfect with `Jupyter` and maybe you will not be able to run the code or the demo without errors (although when reading this the problem may be resolved).

To remove `opencv` from `Anaconda` you can use: `conda remove --yes opencv`
